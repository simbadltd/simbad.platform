# Simbad.Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simbadltd/simbad.platform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simbadltd/simbad.platform)

This project is the quintessence of the development experience accumulated over several years. In short, the problem that this project is designed to solve, arising from the fact that when you're starting any development, you often implement very similar functionality (boilerplate). It can take weeks or even months. This problem becomes even more when prototype/MVP development takes place. In this work every hour is on the account. There is no time, for example to be distracted by the implementation of the persistence aspect. You need to fully focus on verifying your idea or hypothesis. Or you're starting new application development and you've decided to reuse already tested and reliable platform for faster start with designing domain logic and entities. Here comes the Simbad.Platform.
